In Redux Toolkit, createSlice is a function that accepts an initial state, 
an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates
 action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state.

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#file 1: Users.js
 
# Define the slice of the Redux state for managing user data
# Initialize the state with fake user data
# Define actions for adding a user, deleting a user, and updating a user's username

# File 2: App.js

# Import necessary dependencies and actions for managing users

# Define the App component
  # Get a reference to the dispatch function from Redux
  # Get the current state of the user data from Redux
  # Define local state variables for name, username, and newUsername

  # Return the JSX for the component
    # An input field for entering a name, which updates the name state variable
    # An input field for entering a username, which updates the username state variable
    # A button which, when clicked, dispatches the addUser action with the current name and username
    # A section for displaying all users
      # For each user, display:
        # The user's name
        # The user's username
        # An input field for entering a new username, which updates the newUsername state variable
        # A button which, when clicked, dispatches the updateUsername action with the current user's id and newUsername
        # A button which, when clicked, dispatches the deleteUser action with the current user's id

# Export the App component

# File 3: index.js

# Import necessary dependencies

# Configure the Redux store with the user reducer
